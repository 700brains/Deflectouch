- add description of github repository
- set initial tank position to the exact middle of the screen on the left.
- problem: as soon as a touch is recognized, the PQ Labs screen sends *continuously* touch-move events! It doesn't matter if the touch is actually moving -
  he just sends move events with the actual position... -> I now activated the jitter-post-proc engine with a jitter_distance of 0.001
- the tank scatter has a bounding box of 100x100. I don't know where it's taking that from... AND: if i drag from within that bounding box, it doesn't always move!
  --> problem might be that i arrange the two widgets on the tank but the scatter above does not adjust its bounding box so it takes only default-values...
- let the "mirror stock" bar change its size smoothly when a new mirror is placed or an old mirror is removed -> use utils.transision OR an animation
- the deflector scatter also scales the size of both the end_points and the thickness of the line in between.
