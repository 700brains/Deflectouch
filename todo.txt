- set initial tank position to the exact middle of the screen on the left.
- problem: as soon as a touch is recognized, the PQ Labs screen sends *continuously* touch-move events! It doesn't matter if the touch is actually moving -
  he just sends move events with the actual position... -> I now activated the jitter-post-proc engine with a jitter_distance of 0.001
- let the "mirror stock" bar change its size smoothly when a new mirror is placed or an old mirror is removed -> use utils.transision OR an animation (bounce :P)
- game level data: consists of a picture, every pixel is a brick. While loading the level graphical, i draw a polygon around the edges (start-finding algorithm: begin on a outside and move to the center. if found, just follow.)
- settings: music, sound
- help-page: manage in the app-class (like on touchLay)
- possibility for collision check on levels: levels are built out of a pixel array. now we transform the bullets position down to the pixel-array and look, if it collides with a 'black' pixel or whatever.
- settings: they keep not writing the GamePlay Variable into the ini file...
- deflector = completeley build it with canvas instructions
- bug: wird das rohr nicht genau auf 0 eingestellt, verändert sich das nächste mal die tower-position abhängig vom rohrwinkel
- set up the whole window as a fixed size (1024x768) fullscreen with black border
- set github repository description
